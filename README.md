# VulkanTutorial-My-exercise

I'm following the Vulkan Tutorial from https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ and doing things here and there my own way in an attempt to bring some more object oriented sanity to the giant singleton that the tutorial author created. Mainly uploaded to github to share with my friends but everyone is welcome to look at my code.
